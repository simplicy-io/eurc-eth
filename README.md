# EUR-ETH 
EUR is an ERC-20 stablecoin - Smart contract of digital EUR on Ethereum Blockchain


## Overview
The EURC smart contract used OpenZeppelin which is library for secure smart contract development.

## Installation
The guides in the [OpenZeppelin docs site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) will teach how to deploy and interaction to smart contract.

## Step by Step Installation using Truffle
1. Make sure you have node v12.8.3 or higher, check it with
```
node --version
```

2. Install packages
```
yarn
```

4. Download, install and open [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

5. Compile solidity with truffle
```
yarn truffle compile
```

5. Deploy smart contracts to your localhost Ethereum Ganache
```
yarn truffle migrate --network development
```

result of your deployment:

## Interacting from the Console
```
$ yarn truffle console --network development
truffle(development)> Euro = await Euro.deployed()
undefined
```

### Minting Euro coin 
Use Owner adres for examample:0x7904bF7aC4EdC845b2057d2F44A1D19e33468ce5
Minting 500 Euro coins:
We are using 6 decimals which means 500000000 to mint
```
$ truffle(development)> await Euro.mint("0x7904bF7aC4EdC845b2057d2F44A1D19e33468ce5", 500000000)
```

### Sending Euro coin to User
See also [OpenZeppelin documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20)
transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)

User adress example: 0xd7ab3436414E7412c004811ec960c908d34704ef
```
$ truffle(development)> await Euro.transfer("0xd7ab3436414E7412c004811ec960c908d34704ef", 500000000)
```

## Import Account to metamask

```
yarn coverage
```

Lint solidity
```
yarn lint:sol
```

## Connecting to public test networks
see also [Connecting to public test networks](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/connecting-to-public-test-networks)

### Create a new account 
To send transactions in a testnet, you will need a new Ethereum account using mnemonics package
```
yarn mnemonics
drama film snack motion ...
```

### Copy and change secrets
```
cp secrets.json.example secrets.json
```

Copy your mnemonics words to secret.json

### Get Alchemyapi Key and copy your API KEY
https://www.alchemyapi.io/
Copy your API KEY to secret.json

### Get funds
Using [Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
or using [MetaMaskâ€™s faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io/)

### Deploy and migrate to rinkeby
```
yarn truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

### Deploy and migrate to Ropsten
```
yarn truffle migrate --network ropsten
```

### Deploy and migrate to Binance testnet
```
yarn truffle migrate --network binance_testnet
```


## Verify your contract on Binance Smart Chain


1. Generate an API Key on your BSCscan account

If you don't have one yet, just go to [this page](https://bscscan.com/login) to sign up.


Add your BSCscan API key to your secrets.json


2.  Deploy your contract

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network binance_testnet
```

3. Verify your contract

```
truffle run verify BEP20Token@{deployed-address} --network binance_testnet

```

## Step by Step Installation Moonbean using Truffle
